## 🎯 Problem Statement

Communities generate massive amounts of data — citizen complaints, weather, traffic, pollution, water usage, public health — but decision-makers struggle to answer:

- **What** is happening?
- **Why** is it happening?
- **What will** happen next?
- **What should** we do?

**CivicMind** becomes the AI brain for community decision-making.

## 🎬 Killer Demo Flow (3 Minutes)

**Don't demo features. Demo a crisis.**

1. **Detect** → Dashboard shows score dropping 81→68, crisis alert 🔴
2. **Analyze** → Click Ward D on city map, see compound risk
3. **Predict** → AI explains: "Flood risk HIGH because rainfall +40%, drainage complaints +18%"
4. **Agent Timeline** → Watch 4 agents collaborate in real-time
5. **Recommend** → Decision Center shows 6 immediate actions with Impact/Cost
6. **Simulate** → "Deploy emergency teams" → Score 68→76, Flood Risk 86%→57%
7. **Decide** → Mayor makes data-driven decision with full AI explanation

**Detect → Analyze → Predict → Recommend → Simulate → Decide**
