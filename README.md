## 🎯 Problem Statement

Communities generate massive amounts of data — citizen complaints, weather, traffic, pollution, water usage, public health — but decision-makers struggle to answer:

- **What** is happening?
- **Why** is it happening?
- **What will** happen next?
- **What should** we do?

**CivicMind** becomes the AI brain for community decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture Deep-Dive

### 1. Unified Frontend Client Stack
*   **Structure:** Semantic **HTML5** structure optimized for fast rendering and browser search engine indexation.
*   **Styling (Modern Glassmorphic Slate Theme):** Pure **CSS3** design utilizing:
    *   Glassmorphism blur filters (`backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`) with subtle borders (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.07)`).
    *   Interactive radio selection capsules and custom ranges/sliders.
    *   Sleek scrollbar modifications to replace chunky default browser layouts.
    *   Responsive layouts using dynamic grids (`display: grid`) and flexboxes.
    *   Color-coded glowing urgency indicators matching ticket levels.
*   **Application Logic:** Modular **ES6 JavaScript** featuring:
    *   Active view controller and client-side page state retention.
    *   Local database fallbacks to support zero-downtime, fully interactive offline demos via `file:///` protocol.
    *   Dynamic DOM rendering and custom HTML escaper layers.
*   **Data Visualization:** **Chart.js v4 (via CDN)** rendering line charts with confidence bounds, multi-dataset ward comparisons, complaint categories doughnuts, and simulator outcomes comparison graphs.
*   **Icons & Assets:** **FontAwesome Icons v6.5** and Google Fonts (**Sora**, **Outfit**, **JetBrains Mono**).

### 2. High-Performance API Backend
*   **Framework:** **FastAPI 0.111.0** (Python 3.10+) serving high-speed JSON responses.
*   **Routing & Controllers:** Segmented routers (Dashboard, Chat, Predict, Recommend, Simulate, Agents, Decision Center).
*   **Static Serving:** Configured via `aiofiles` and `StaticFiles` to serve the unified static UI natively from root `/`, creating a single-port deployment structure.
*   **ASGI Server:** **Uvicorn 0.30.0** handling async request loops and reload triggers.
*   **Validation:** **Pydantic v2** enforcing strict request/response schema boundaries.

### 3. AI Agents & Machine Learning Core
*   **Predictive Modeling:** **Scikit-Learn 1.5.0** & **NumPy** power ML algorithms that forecast flood probability, water scarcity margins, traffic indices, waste overflow limits, and emission metrics.
*   **Data Manipulation:** **Pandas 2.2.2** generating time-series forecast vectors.
*   **Generative AI Orchestration:** **Google Gemini 2.5** (via `google-generativeai` and Vertex AI) powers the:
    *   **Decision Strategy Synthesizer:** Compiles raw ward statistics into actionable policy targets.
    *   **Intelligent Chat Assistant:** Natural language search answering with citations, references, and follow-up suggestion blocks.
*   **Multi-Agent Collaborative Matrix:**
    *   🌿 **EcoWatch Agent:** Assesses environment, air pollution spikes, and weather anomalies.
    *   🚗 **TransitFlow Agent:** Assesses road delays, delays, and scheduling bottle-necks.
    *   👥 **CivicVoice Agent:** Evaluates citizen grievances volume and public sentiment indices.
    *   💡 **Strategy Engine:** Recommendation synthesis compiling individual metrics into critical priority queues.

### 4. Database & Cloud Architecture (Enterprise Grade)
*   **Data Warehouse:** **Google BigQuery** (leveraged for historical logs storage).
*   **Object Storage:** **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** holding raw unstructured reports.
*   **RAG Engine:** **Vertex AI Vector Search** providing fast context search injections for LLM requests.
*   **Containerization:** **Docker** and **Docker Compose** orchestrating isolated client/server processes.
